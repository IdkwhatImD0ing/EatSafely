### Inspiration
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are an estimated 48 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States each year. This results in approximately 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. The most common causes of foodborne illness are norovirus, Salmonella, and Clostridium perfringens. The CDC also estimates that the economic cost of foodborne illness in the United States is around $15.6 billion per year. A portion of this would be from spoiled food.
 
 ### Purpose: EatSafely is a web app that detects spoiled food to prevent hospitalizations that could have monetary consequences.
 
 With the integration of Machine Learning and some dataset the webapp will be able to identify each image of a fruit uploaded and determines if it's is safe to eat.\
Dataset is taken from this website.
